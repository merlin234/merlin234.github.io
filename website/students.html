          <p>Meeting with a counselor is a chance to explore one’s hopes and fears, and determine possible courses of
            action or resolution in a respectful, non-judgmental, and confidential setting. </p>
          <p>At times students need additional support for assessment, accommodations, and diagnostic services to
            support their eligibility for other services at AUM. When it is appropriate and ethical we attempt to fill
            these needs as best we can for students who may not have access to outside services.</p>

          <p>Academic advisors serve an important role in helping students get registered for classes and guiding them
            along their educational journeys. Not only will your advisor assist you in selecting the classes you need
            for graduation, he/she can also serve as a resource to you for any questions you may have during your time
            at AUM.</p>
          <p>Upon admission to AUM, you are assigned an advisor based upon your major. These advisors are located in
            various offices across campus. If you are not sure who your advisor is or how to get in touch with him/her,
            please contact us.</p>
